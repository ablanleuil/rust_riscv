# RISC-V Rust sandbox

See the [online
documentation](http://shumush.fr/static/rust_riscv/riscv_sandbox/index.html) for
more details.

This crate was made to help people use the
[RISC-V ISA](https://riscv.org/specifications/) to build system courses, but
turns out it was a very powerful tool to create simulators and we used it to
implement [SIMT-X](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01356202) and work on it.
